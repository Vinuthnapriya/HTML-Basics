HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page

p=paragraph
h1=large heading
body is an element that contain links, paragraphs,headings,images,tables,list
<title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page


Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag


#structure of html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page title</title>
    </head>
<body>
      <h1>This is a heading</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content 
inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.


 Tim Berners-Lee is the inventer of HTML


You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference; it is up to you.


All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>


<!DOCTYPE html>
-> it declares the type of the document.
-> It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
->  is not case sensitive.


HTML links are defined with the <a> tag.
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag
elements are the tags like p, h1, img, a, br etc.

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>


Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
1.href attribute:
    The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
    it defines the hyperlink.
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

2.src attribute:
    The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
    <img src="img_girl.jpg">

3.width and height attribute:
    the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels).
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

4.alt attribute:
    tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a 
    slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

5.style attribute:
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

6.lang attribute:
    You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define 
the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

7.title attribute:
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
    The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element.
    <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>



Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.



All HTML elements can have attributes
->The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
->The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
->The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
->The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
->The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
->The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
->The title attribute defines some extra information about an element



Horizontal Rules:
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>



In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored



The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.




<p>  	Defines a paragraph
<hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
<br>	Inserts a single line break
<pre>	Defines pre-formatted text
